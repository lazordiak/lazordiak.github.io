  <h2>Any Iliad, This Iliad -- My Machine Bard</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      Do you know the Iliad?
    </p>
    <p>
      How about this one?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're familiar with the "Western Canon", odds are you've heard the story of the fall of Troy. You might be familiar with
      Achilles, the greatest of Greek warriors, and the Trojan Horse, and the judgement of Paris. If you know a little more you'll probably recognize the
      less-discussed characters, like Nestor and Polydamas and Teucer. It's a story that's been circulating more or less in its current form since
      around 450 BC, so people have had plenty of time to get acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, this isn't the /whole/ story. The story we've had passed down to us has a story of its own (it was commissioned by an Athenian ruler),
      and in fact it's only one of the myriad forms the Iliad has taken throughout history. In the tradition of oral poetry,
      the Iliad was sung over and over by traveling bards, and though the bones of the story stayed mostly the same each individual telling was different.
      We can see the remnants of this in some of the textual variations we have (link to papyrus fragments).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm enamored with this idea of fluidity and ambiguity: of the individual, of a culture, of a story. So I built my own bard, to tell a different story each time.
      I've always felt that wherever there is data there's a story, and converting that data into something meaningful is one of the most valuable
      endeavors a person can undertake.

    Here's how it works: we started by scraping the text of the top 25 books on Project Gutenberg. We
    also selected ten characters from the Iliad, five Greeks and five Trojans, and assigned each character three
    different words that were meant to be somewhat representative of their personality and/or role in the story.
    Using Python, we built a script that compiles a JSON file of all number of times every keyword appears in each book,
    (insert pic of json here), and scaled the word occurrences so that they would be in roughly the same range.
      <p>

      </p>
      The Iliad was many stories -- though we only have the one, it was sung over and over with countless variations.
      <a href="https://lazordiak.github.io/iliad-storytelling/" class="class1">Here</a> are some of those variations.
      include 25 books used, some images of process and the words of each character, etc
