  <h2>Any Iliad, This Iliad -- My Machine Bard</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      Do you know the Iliad?
    </p>
    <p>
      How about this one?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're familiar with the "Western Canon", odds are you've heard the story of the fall of Troy. You might be familiar with
      Achilles, the greatest of Greek warriors, and the Trojan Horse, and the judgement of Paris. If you know a little more you'll probably recognize the
      less-discussed characters, like Nestor and Polydamas and Teucer. It's a story that's been circulating more or less in its current form since
      around 450 BC, so people have had plenty of time to get acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, this isn't the /whole/ story. The story we've had passed down to us has a story of its own (it was commissioned by an Athenian ruler),
      and in fact it's only one of the myriad forms the Iliad has taken throughout history. In the tradition of oral poetry,
      the Iliad was sung over and over by traveling bards, and though the bones of the story stayed mostly the same each individual telling was different.
      We can see the remnants of this in some of the textual variations we have (link to papyrus fragments).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm enamored with this idea of fluidity and ambiguity: of the individual, of a culture, of a story. So I built my own bard, to tell a different story each time.
      I've always felt that wherever there is data there's a story, and converting that data into something meaningful is one of the most valuable
      endeavors a person can undertake (and that this is the point of art, maybe??)
    </p>

    Here's how it works: we started by scraping the text of the top 25 books on Project Gutenberg. We
    also selected ten characters from the Iliad, five Greeks and five Trojans, and assigned each character three
    different words that were meant to be somewhat representative of their personality and/or role in the story.
    Using Python, we built a script that compiles a JSON file of all number of times every keyword appears in each book,
    (insert pic of json here), and scaled the word occurrences so that they would be in roughly the same range.
    Then, for each character, we assign them
    one of the twenty five books. We add the word occurrences for each of the three words together
    to get a total score. This score is divided by the total score of all characters to get
    the "level of influence" for each character in that particular story.

  <p>
    The story itself is my own translation
    of the first twenty lines of the Iliad with a with certain sections added and removed. For each of these
    changed sections there are ten possible choices we can use to fill them in, one for each character.
    We use a JS script to randomly select one of the characters with a probability
    based on their influence score from before,
    and in that way we populate the story. Thus, each time the page is refreshed each
    character gets a new book, a new score, and a new story is written.
