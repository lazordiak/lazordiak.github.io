  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Hello! Hope you're doing well. I'm Schuyler. I graduated <a href="https://www.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Vassar College</a> in 2017
      with a BA in <a href="https://greekandromanstudies.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Classics</a>, another in <a href="https://cogsci.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Cognitive Science</a>,
      and a minor in <a href="https://art.vassar.edu/art-history/" class="class1">Art History</a>. I was and am interested in exploring different ways of thinking, the different activities they inspire,
      generally just finding the most interesting ways of ramming ideas together at high speed. Mostly I do this by making things and then thinking
      about them, and some of those things end up here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm studying as a Master's student at the ITP program at NYU. My interests
      include refactoring this website so it doesn't look awful and you, if you're interesting!
