  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Hello! Hope you're doing well. I'm Schuyler. I graduated <a href="https://www.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Vassar College</a> in 2017
      with a BA in <a href="https://greekandromanstudies.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Classics</a>, another in <a href="https://cogsci.vassar.edu/" class="class1">Cognitive Science</a>,
      and a minor in <a href="https://art.vassar.edu/art-history/" class="class1">Art History</a>. I was and am interested in exploring different ways of thinking, the different activities they inspire,
      generally just finding the most interesting ways of ramming ideas together at high speed. Mostly I do this by making things and then thinking
      about them, and some of those things end up here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm studying as a Master's student at the ITP program at NYU. My interests
      include refactoring this website so it doesn't look awful and you, if you're interested
      in talking!
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrons are always trying to get to the lowest energy state, this is something
      I learned in chemistry before I stopped taking chemistry. I think that people are
      like electrons, always trying to fall to the state where we can expend the least
      amount of energy trying to be who we are. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to make things that help people find those spaces of low energy,
      in themselves and in the world.
