  <h2>How do People Form Categories - An Exploration</h2>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Over summer 2017, I designed, ran and analyzed data investigating how people
    form categories (such as dog, tree, etc.) internally, and which conditions
    are most conducive to learning certain categories.</p>
    <p>Previous study (Andrews et al, 2011) indicated people learned categories best when the stimuli
    were "triples" (i.e. three items presented together) of three different categories
    with one item from each category and learning mode was categorical (i.e. you guessed
    the correct category and were given feedback).</p>
    <p>However, competing evidence (Patterson and Kurtz, 2015) showed learning was
    best when stimuli were pairs from the same category and learning mode was observational
    (i.e. you were shown the items and the correct category without interaction).</p>
    <p>Our goal was to discover whether this latter finding was due to learning mode
    or category type.<p>
    <p>I made a poster that explains the rest better than I can, so <a href="images/ursi.jpg" class="class1">here</a> it is!</p>
