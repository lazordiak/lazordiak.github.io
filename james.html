  <h2>"Life as Mist" or, "another in an endless list of thing I've built while ignoring something more important"</h2>

    <p>I'm not a very religious person, as a rule, but a bit ago my friend pointed out
      a particular Biblical verse which struck him and, in turn, me. This is James, chapter 4, 13-14:</p>
    <p>Ἄγε νῦν οἱ λέγοντες Σήμερον ἢ αὔριον πορευσόμεθα εἰς τήνδε τὴν πόλιν καὶ
      ποιήσομεν ἐκεῖ ἐνιαυτὸν καὶ ἐμπορευσόμεθα καὶ κερδήσομεν: οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε
      τῆς αὔριον ποία ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν: ἀτμὶς γάρ ἐστε πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη, ἔπειτα καὶ ἀφανιζομένη.</p>
    <p>In English, that's:</p>
    <p>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and
      spend a year there, and trade, and get gain." Whereas you don't know what
      your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor,
      that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</p>
    <p>In Latin,</p>
    <p>ecce nunc qui dicitis hodie aut crastino ibimus in illam civitatem et faciemus
       quidem ibi annum et mercabimur et lucrum faciemus qui ignoratis quid erit in
       crastinum quae enim est vita vestra vapor est ad modicum parens deinceps exterminatur</p>
    <p>This small script takes all the letters from line fourteen of the latin version,
      "QUAEENIMESTVITAVESTRAVAPORESTADMODICUMPARENSDEINCEPSEXTERMINATUR", and continually
      rearranges them in an 8 by eight grid.</br>
      Sometimes we get so absorbed; in our reflection, in our meals, in our careers,
      our marriages, our lives. Here is a panacea for all those things. You can watch
      it until you die, or even longer.</br>
