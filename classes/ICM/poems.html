  <h2>Bad Rhyming Poem Generator</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">

      "Do something with text". All right, all right! Text is actually something pretty
      dear to my heart, and I've made a number of text-based projects. The one I'm most
      proud of is my Iliad Generator, which is actually something you can view under
      the projects section of my site. Well, what I  made this week isn't quite as
      impressive, in my opinion, but everything is special in its own special way.

      So, on to brass tacks. After seeing all the little poem examples on the RiTa
      example page, I figured I'd make my own. One of the hardest parts of this, surprisingly,
      was generating a type-writer like substring letter by letter for the intro,
      and after that using the RiTa interface was (wonderfully, refreshingly) easy.
      I used RiTa to grab a few adjectives to fill in my poem, and then grabbed a rhyming
      word for the very end. The kicker, though... not everything rhymes. So, I made a
      poem generator that apologizes when it can't find any rhymes, which, you know,
      is at least being honest. The poems constantly refresh at a rate one can actually
      follow because I lowered the frame rate, so now you can have poems potentially forever --
      isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, I felt quite lonely, and my friend sent me a poem that cheered me up.
      These poems aren't quite as good as that one, but perhaps in some respect
      quantity can make up for quality. Lonely people deserve to have poems on hand. So,
      this is a sketch for those people.
