  <h2>Draw A Song</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This week's assignment was to do something with music. I was teamed up with
      my classmate Tito. My original idea was to generate sound based on pixel
      values in a camera feed, but then Tito told me he'd been playing around with
      the Spotify API. APIs were something we hadn't really worked with yet, so I
      thought why not give them a shot? While we originally thought about using
      object detection to find a song to play on Spotify, I found an instantiation
      of Doodlenet in P5 while searching the Internet. Doodlenet is a neural network
      that looks at what you draw and categorizes it, which is pretty sick (the Doodlenet
      in P5 I found is <a class="class1" href="https://editor.p5js.org/ima_ml/sketches/IbXlN6voN">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we decided that instead of object detection we would use Doodlenet to pick
      a song from the Spotify API. It requires getting an authentification token, but
      after that the code is actually pretty straightforward, and it works well.

      Originally I was also trying to use the Google Images API to pull an image
      from Google Search that would accompany the song we pulled, but after a few
      hours of playing around I couldn't get that to work. To make up for it, I
      instead added a few different coloring modes to our project. It's the little
      things, right?

      I've known a lot of people who were always wondering about the correlation
      between what they saw and what others saw. And I was very close with one of them
      who happened to be a musician, among other things. So, this is a sketch
      for that person.
