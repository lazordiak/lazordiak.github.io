      This week's assignment was to do something with sound. Sound... Well, I spent
      a long while thinking about what to do with sound, before I decided this would be
      a good time to dive into ml5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ml5, for those who might be unfamiliar, is a machine learning library for the
      P5 system. Having implemented a few machine learning models in Python, I was
      incredibly surprised by how easy Ml5 was to use. The sound recognition, which
      recognizes a handy amount of words including "yes", "no", "go", "stop", and
      numbers, works very well with minimal setup. So, I decided to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the voice commands, I thought I could make something that moved
      according to what one said. Since the assignment was to make something that
      visualizes audio, I figured why not make something that draws according to
      your commands?
    </p>
    <p>
      First, I decided on which different states I wanted to explore. In my schematic,
      "up" "down" "left" and "right" are the directions the brush can move in, "go" and "stop"
      dictate whether the pointer moves, and "yes" and "no" dictate whether the pointer
      will paint or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each ellipse is an object with values for its own position and color. The program
      checks to see which state it's currently in, and if it's in the correct state
      to paint it pushes a new ellipse to the array. The array is spliced immediately
      afterwards (so that there's only ever one ellipse in the array) and then the
      array is drawn onto the canvas.
