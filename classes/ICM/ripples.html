  <h2>Flashing Ripples</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This week's assignment was to do something with color. I didn't have an idea
      right off the bat for this one like I did last week, so I thought I would
      start with something simple and then... work my way up.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I started with ripples. Water has been on my mind recently, for a number
      of reasons, and I thought there might be some interesting things I could do
      with them. I googled P5 ripples real quick and the first link took me to
      <a class="class1" href="https://editor.p5js.org/cah689/sketches/SJIolunpZ">this sketch</a>,
      which had a very basic ripple object constructed. I used that as a template,
      and then changed the constructor and the draw and setup functions to have a
      few more parameters for colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I changed the mouseClick function so that it would create a ripple in a
      random place, rather than just creating it wherever the mouse was pressed.
      Then, I changed it so that the stroke of the ripple would be a random color
      that was between 0 and the current diameter of the ripple, so that the color
      would gradually flash more colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was pretty and came up with some nice ripples, but I felt like there was
      more that I could do, and I wanted to utilize a bit more of what we'd learned
      this week. So, I decided I would make something happenw when the ripples
      intersected. Trying to figure out how ripples intersect turned out to be pretty
      tough, especially because we had an array of ripples. I watched through this
      Coding Train video on object intersections and was able to get the sketch
      to recognize when the ripples were intersecting, but then I had to figure out
      what I wanted them to do after the intersected. Since we'd gone over lerpcolor
      in class, I thought it'd be a good time to test it out. So, I told the sketch
      that when the ripples intersected I wanted to have the ripples fill with the
      lerp color of the two ripple strokes. The end result... was pretty trippy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we go through life we change and expand, and sometimes we meet others who
      feel like they help fill us up and round us out in ways we hadn't anticipated.
      So, this is a sketch for those people.
