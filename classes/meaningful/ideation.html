  <h2>Product Idea</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      Serendipity bot is a bot that integrates with your team messaging app (like Slack or Microsoft Team) and brings intuitive, naturalistic interaction to remote workers. Instead of large team-building exercises, which can often feel intimidating or forced, Serendipity bot seeks to emulate the smaller things that help teammates bond -- little conversations in the hallway, doodles in a colleague’s notebook, and other ephemeral acts of familiarity that are lacking in remote work.
    </p>
    <h2>Current State Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Dale logs on and sorts through information on Slack Channels, deciding what they will work on for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dale communicates with their teammates only when necessary, to bring up problems or collaborate on solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly posts in their company’s ‘random’ channel, but doesn’t really take the time to engage there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After work, Dale logs out of the company’s Slack channel and attends to their personal life. They have no reason to connect with colleagues outside of work, since virtual communication is more difficult than seeing real-life friends.
    </p>
    <h2>Future State Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Dale logs onto work, and Serendipity bot shows him another colleague of his who has recently logged on, prompting them if they’d like to take a couple of minutes to chat.

    </p>
    <p>
      During his day, other colleagues who have turned on Serendipity bot have the option to engage with him and the rest of their team. Serendipity bot prompts Dale to do a quick doodle of something interesting in his home, and sends it to a random teammate, who has the option to respond with a brief message.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the work day comes to a close, Serendipity bot collects a list of colleagues who are interested in sharing dinner or a drink that night, and randomly matches them up.
