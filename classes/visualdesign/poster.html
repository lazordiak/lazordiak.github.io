  <h2>Poster for the ITP Winter Show!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      So... We needed to design a poster for the ITP Winter Show. The brief was
      to make something to show the more "human" side of ITP.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time thinking about my own experiences at ITP, and the thing
      that stood out to me the most was the process of iteration and exploration
      that one goes through at ITP while building a project, and all the twists
      and turns it can take. I think that's something very special about the ITP
      community and the ITP environment, and when I considered how to translate
      that to a visual the first thing that came to my mind was, for some reason, board games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, I thought about Candyland. Specifically specifically, I thought
      about how in Candyland there were some places you could land on that sent you
      forward, and others that sent you back. Of course, as soon as I was considering
      that I realized that the game I actually wanted was snakes and ladders.

      Snakes and ladders is a game of pure chance. If you haven't played it, here's
      how you do it: you start at the bottom left and have to work your way to the
      top left. Each player takes turns rolling dice, and then they move the number
      of squares that they rolled. If you end your turn at the bottom of a ladder,
      you ascend the ladder, thereby skipping a bunch of squares. If you end your
      turn at the top of a snake, you go down the snake, losing ground. Milton-Bradley
      published a kids' version of this game called Chutes and Ladders, which is how
      my poster started.

    <p>
      I took a color palette from the Chutes and Ladders picture and started by making
      a grid of squares for my game board, 48 in all. I put the information for the
      show at the bottom right, using the font Myriad Pro. Then, I filled in the squares
      in the game board with the same color as the game board, and I the color for
      the main poster body I made the red color from the chutes in the board game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put numbers in each of the squares, and then all that was left was to find some
      snakes and ladders. I ended up using <a class="class1" href="https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=Snakes+and+Ladders&asset_id=224165722">
      this set</a> from Adobe Stock, which I modified a little to suit my purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My final touch was to add some ITP-specific flavor to the game I'd made. In
      my head, the game would be a metaphor for building a project, so I included things
      like asking friends for help or staying up too late as the basis for the snakes
      and ladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I had a few different color schemes which I tried out -- you can
      see them all below, but I think I like the red one best.
