  <h2>1: Typography</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      So, this week's assignment has to do with branding, and where I started was
      typography, since it's been consistently alluded to as the most important aspect
      of what we're learning. My first (and, really, only stop) was Google Fonts, but
      I was in luck here because we'd already done an exercise in class where we had
      to shop around for fonts for ourselves. I took those the ones I'd found there as
      a starting points and then spent my time browsing Google Fonts to try and see
      if there were any better combinations or interesting pairings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a few hours roaming around Google Fonts (it's more addicting than I
      would assume) and ultimately put together a list of fifteen contenders. Looking through
      them, I could tell there were a few commonalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most noticeable of these is that, with only one outlier, most of the fonts I'd
      chosen are ones I'd consider thin. The fact of the matter is that my name is not
      the most elegant: it's spelled untintuitively (to English speakers, at least),
      it's long, it uses a bunch of weird letters in tandem, the capitals are strange,
      and the length is a bit off (not to mention the space between de and Vos, which
      I've alternately kept and dropped depending on my mood.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my favorite, at least without a space between the de and Vos, is Cinzel
      Decorative, as seen here:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:'Cinzel Decorative', cursive; font-size:40px">
      Schuyler deVos
    </p>
    <p>
      What I like about it is the way that the S and V, as the capital letters in
      name, stand out. My name includes a lot of reading, relatively, so I feel like
      it's good to have those landmarks. Additionally, the font is based off of Roman
      lettering but also, with the flourishes, looks a bit more playful and mysterious to
      me. It reminds me of something I'd find while exploring old ruined temples in the
      middle of a magical forest, which is honestly exactly where I want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it doesn't work as well for me when the de and Vos are separated. Personally
      I feel like that makes the whole thing harder, but here are two fonts I find
      acceptable when my name is rendered that way. The first is Poirest One, the
      second is Goudy Bookletter 1911.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; font-size:40px">
      Schuyler de Vos
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Goudy Bookletter 1911', serif; font-size:40px">
      Schuyler de Vos
    </p>
    <p>
      For reference, here is everything I looked at together in a picture.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/fonts1.png" alt="A screenshot of Adobe Audition."/>
    <img src="../../images/fonts2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Adobe Audition."/>
    <p>
      Not to be forgotten is the importance of finding fonts that pair well with your chosen font.
      For this, I honestly just followed the Google Fonts recommendation. I happen to think
      both Raleway and Open Sans look good with Cinzel Decorative. Then again, Open Sans looks
      good with a lot of things.
    </p>
    <h2>2: Palette</h2>
    <p>
      While one of our previous assignments required us to come up with a personal
      color palette, I wasn't sure I was quite satisfied with what I'd come up with.
