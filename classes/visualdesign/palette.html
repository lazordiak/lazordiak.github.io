  <h2>Personal Color Palette!</h2>

      This week's assignment: pick out a color palette that represents you, and
      then make a few designs with it. I really like these assignments geared
      towards figuring out an "aesthetic of you", even if I have a lot of trouble
      making decisions about the actual content.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, I used Khroma, which is an ML algorithm that has you pick a bunch
      of different colors you like and which then generates colors that it thinks
      you would like -- pretty standard ML stuff. I knew going into the project
      that my favorite color was orange, so I ended up picking a lot of oranges,
      but strangely enough the algorithm didn't end up giving me a lot of orange.
      Just goes to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up going through the almost infinite Khroma combinations and picking
      out a few that stood out to me. Here's the palette I ended up with.

      After going to the help session with Chelsea I got the idea to use some of
      the shape and gradient tools in Illustrator. First up, some
      spirals.

      I also checked out the gradients tool, and a pattern generator site patterncooler.com.

      I think that, when used in simple color application, the two green-blues tend
      to merge together. However, I also played around with the <a class="class1" href="https://tinkrmind.me/2017/10/04/colors/">
      palette conversion tool</a> that Amitabh made last year, and it turns out they
      make great backgrounds.
