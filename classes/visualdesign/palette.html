  <h2>Personal Color Palette!</h2>

      This week's assignment: pick out a color palette that represents you, and
      then make a few designs with it. I really like these assignments geared
      towards figuring out an "aesthetic of you", even if I have a lot of trouble
      making decisions about the actual content.

    <p>
      To start, I used Khroma, which is an ML algorithm that has you pick a bunch
      of different colors you like and which then generates colors that it thinks
      you would like -- pretty standard ML stuff. I knew going into the project
      that my favorite color was orange, so I ended up picking a lot of oranges,
      but strangely enough the algorithm didn't end up giving me a lot of orange.
      Just goes to show.
    </p>

      I ended up going through the almost infinite Khroma combinations and picking
      out a few that stood out to me. Here's the palette I ended up with.

      After going to the help session with Chelsea I got the idea to use some of
      the shape tools in Illustrator, as well as the pattern tool. First up, some
      spirals.
