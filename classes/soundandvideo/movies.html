  <h2>Two Horror Movies!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      So our original storyboard for this class was for a documentary about some sort of horrific
      event that happened at ITP. We'd investigate, maybe get caught by a ghost or
      whatever, that was that. When we went to film, though, we decided we might
      want to make something that was more like an actual horror movie, or at
      least trying to be scary. We thought it'd be something unique and an interesting
      challenge.

      The movie we ended up making from that was very abstract, and though we all
      really liked it it didn't fit the prompt of the class, which was to do either
      an informercial or a documentary. So, we had to do it over.

      The new movie we shot was more in line with our original storyboard, which was
      a farcical ghost hunt in line with a show like Ghost Hunters and the found-footage
      craze started by Blair Witch Project.

      Though making two movies was kind of stressful, it was great that we got to
      investigate so many different ways of telling stories. The first movie is
      much more focused on setting a mood and exploring different camera shots and
      different editing effects (we made it much darker and set the blue way up to
      simulate a creepy atmosphere). The second movie is much more about building a
      narrative arc and telling a very short story. I think both of these techniques
      have their place, and my appreciation for different modes of storytelling
      is richer through this experience. In the future, not gonna lie, I want to
      try even weirder stuff.
