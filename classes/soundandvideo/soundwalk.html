  <h2>Soundwalk in the East Village!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      I got this sound walk started the way I would have really liked -- completely randomly.
      I was taking the F train up to 23 street and was going to go do the Met one later (admittedly
      since it was the shortest), but I figured I'd pass through the east side and might as well do
      the poetry walk, since that's where it was located.
      </p>
    <p>
      I didn't realize it was an hour and a half, but that's how life works, and it's
      wonderful!
      </p>
    <p>
      While taking the walk, there were three main themes that came to mind:
      the form of the sound walk itself, the content of the sound walk, and the real
      world that, inevitably, intrudes upon the sound walk. So, let's tackle each of
      those.
      </p>
    <h3>Form</h3>
    <p>
      This gives me a bit of a better idea about what a sound walk is -- they tell
      you to go somewhere and then there are sounds. The ones I'd imagined were a
      lot more abstract, but this was pretty concrete. I think it's cool they had
      such a well-defined area for their walk (exclusively east village). It makes
      me wonder whether there's a sound walk you could do just anywhere (but would
      that be any different than just music or ambient noise?)
      </p>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>
      I liked this! At the beginning I didn't really see myself wandering around
      for an hour listening to this history lesson, especially since I'd heard the
      other ones were much more atmospheric and eerie, which appealed to me. But I
      think this is important history, and the ability to be there walking the same
      streets is really useful. It keeps the history from becoming dry. I wish they'd
      had more miscellaneous sounds, though.
      </p>
    <h3>Real Life</h3>
    <p>
      Ahhh, real life. This is the most important part, I'd say. There were definitely
      a few times in the sound walk that I ran into roadblocks (or at least awkward situations)
      that the creators couldn't have anticipated. Near the start of the walk you need
      to go into Saint Mark's chapel and walk into the second floor to gaze out of the
      window. The problem is, there were a bunch of young girls doing some sort of dance
      class up there, and people were definitely giving me some odd looks. I went
      down to hang around in the courtyard instead, but... people were giving me odd
      looks out the window.
      </p>
    <p>
      Later, I was supposed to hang around outside of a church or soup kitchen or
      something... but I couldn't find it at all. I legitimately think it was destroyed
      and replaced by a modern apartment building. Other buildings they wanted me
      to explore were closed or sometimes I just couldn't find them either.
      </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This definitely makes me think about how I want my sound walk to stand the test
      of time. Being too specific runs the risk of making a sound walk that can become
      quickly outdated. At the same time, it reminds me of the importance of time in
      any piece of audio or visual media.
