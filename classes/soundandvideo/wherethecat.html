  <h2>Soundwalk About Finding a Cat</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      We had a lot of different ideas swirling around for our soundwalk. At first
      we were thinking of doing some sort of secret mission esque thing, but that
      kind of fell through. One of the big debates we had was whether we wanted a
      more abstract soundwalk (like 9:09) or something like the Passing Strangers
      sound walk where someone says "go and do this thing".
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, we latched onto an idea provided to us, in passing, by Nick Grant
      about a "cat cafe". This was mostly because Katie and Stacey love cats, but as
      always it's best to make art that's related to what you love.

      After we had the idea decided, the second part was building the story. This
      process evolved in tandem with figuring out where in the physical ITP space we wanted
      to explore -- one good piece of advice we received was to not use elevators, so
      we decided we could just start in the elevator lobby on the fourth floor. After
      this we looked through some of the sounds we'd collected and based the stops
      in our sound walk on those: the wooden mirror, the  ping-pong table, the shop and
      finally to the kitchen.
