  <h2>Soundwalk About Finding a Cat!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      We had a lot of different ideas swirling around for our soundwalk. At first
      we were thinking of doing some sort of secret mission esque thing, but that
      kind of fell through. One of the big debates we had was whether we wanted a
      more abstract soundwalk (like 9:09) or something like the Passing Strangers
      sound walk where someone says "go and do this thing".
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, we latched onto an idea provided to us, in passing, by Nick Grant
      about a "cat cafe". This was mostly because Katie and Stacey love cats, but as
      always it's best to make art that's related to what you love.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had the idea decided, the second part was building the story. This
      process evolved in tandem with figuring out where in the physical ITP space we wanted
      to explore -- one good piece of advice we received was to not use elevators, so
      we decided we could just start in the elevator lobby on the fourth floor. After
      this we looked through some of the sounds we'd collected and based the stops
      in our sound walk on those: the wooden mirror, the  ping-pong table, the shop and
      finally to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we had it all plotted out, we wrote up the narration, where we would tell
      people where to go and what to pay attention to. Schuyler and Stacy recorded
      all the narration and sounds that were needed for the new script (which we didn't
      already have), and then Katie edited them together in Adobe Audition.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this we had a rough draft, and we spent the next day testing it out. What
      we found the first go through is that some of the timings were off, and we needed
      to adjust how long the time between some of the narration was. We were also a bit
      worried that people wouldn't be able to figure out where to go, so we tweaked a
      little bit of the narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we test ran it on Nick Grant, who'd been the genesis of the idea, and
      he declared it a success!

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>
      We definitely had the most... casual/humorous/light-hearted of the sound walks.
      I think I was certainly influenced by the soundwalk I went on, passing strangers,
      which was much more concrete than the other soundwalks. We also were the group
      with the most amount of people, and it seems to me that the more people you have
      collaborating on your project (assuming equity of participation) the more concrete
      and less personal your work is going to be, as a general rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd definitely be interested in exploring a more abstract soundwalk -- I really
      liked some of the sense hunt content. One of the things I liked that we did
      were the props, as I like the idea of interacting with the environment a bit
      more directly, though I understand that might limit the "timelessness" of the
      soundwalk, not that ours isn't relatively dated in the first place.
