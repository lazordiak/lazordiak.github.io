  <h2>An LED Button Combination Lock</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">

    <p>
      This week's class was all about digital input and output -- turning things on
      and sending signals through our microcontrollers. At the end of the lab, it
      suggests a practical application of this: a combination lock. Okay, I thought.
      How about I make a combination lock with some LEDs and buttons. Should be easy enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      How very wrong I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      My setup was three buttons wired to my microcontroller as inputs on pins D2,
      D3, and D4. Two LEDs were wired as outputs on pins D5 and D6. The idea is that
      one LED, D6, is lit up by default, and when the correct button press combination
      is entered D6 LED shuts off and the D5 LED lights up.
    </p>
    <p>
      My assumption was that if I used a series of nested if statements in the Arduino
      code, I could accomplish this switch easily. So I wrote something along the lines
      of "if bottom button is pressed, then if top button is pressed, then if middle button
      is pressed, turn D6 off and turn D5 on". This spectacularly failed to work. The
      bottom LED did turn off and the top did turn on, but ONLY when all three buttons
      were held down, and the order didn't matter at all. In effect, I'd made a switch
      that switched when three buttons were pressed at the same time, which I definitely
      didn't want.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I started some troubleshooting. I identified two problems. One was the speed.
      Arduino was running at something like 60 loops per second, so it's no surprise the
      light was switching instantaneously. Even if there was some single moment of delay
      between the input not being entered correctly and the input being entered correctly,
      human eyes wouldn't perceive it. Also, the if statements were structured in a way
      that, at some point during these incredibly fast loops, they were all going to be true.
      Holding the buttons was the only way to keep registering the push, because my simple
      script didn't remember state.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I decided I needed a state machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helpfully, I found <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/StateChangeDetection?from=Tutorial.ButtonStateChange" class="class1">
      this code snippet</a> on the Arduino website, which seemed like a useful basis for
      my own state machine. It had a way of saving button presses in state from loop to
      loop, which was exactly what I needed. I rewrote it to keep three buttons in state,
      and I used the buttonPressCounter variable to keep track of whether each button had
      been pushed or not (so it was either zero or one). If a button was pushed out of
      sequence, the button state was supposed to go back to zero. I also increased the
      delay to 100, just to make doubly sure there was no bounceback.
    </p>
    <p>
      This... kind of worked. It registered the correct button order, but the thing is
      the sequence wasn't resetting when the wrong button was pressed, so that even if
      you pressed yellow then blue then blue then blue then blue THEN green it'd still
      light up. This wasn't ideal for a combination lock, since anyone would eventually
      just stumble onto the correct order.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I did a little bit of tinkering. I'd been resetting buttonState when the incorrect
      order was entered, but instead I tried resetting buttonPushCounter. My reasoning here
      was that if we reset the pushCounter instead of the state we'll never get an
      inccorect combination triggering the light, since the pushCounter at this point was
      referenced in every if statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also kind of worked, but a bit better this time. The LED DID only turn
      on when the correct order was pressed, but all three buttons had to be held
      at the same time, and the light turned off once they were released. I suspect
      it had something to do with the way state was redefined at the beginning of each
      loop, but at this point (since it was past midnight) I declared my combination
      lock a temporary win. Check back in a few days when I've gotten the chance to
      debug this further, and we may have a 100% foolproof lock -- that is, foolproof
      to anyone who can't guess a three-button combination.
