  <h2>Serial Communication Demonstration</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This week's assignment was to get a sketch you've made in p5 to respond to
      an arduino through serial communication. I'm not taking the first part of ICM, so...
      I was definitely rusty on P5. I ended up making a simple little sketch where the
      position of a regular ol' potentiometer increases and decreases a fader in a P5
      sketch. This was in preparation for my midterm. Not super complex, but proves I've
      got serial communication under my belt, at least.
