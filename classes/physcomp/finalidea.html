  <h2>Physical Computation Final Idea</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">

Put your project plan,  timeline, system diagram and brief description and testing plan, on your blog.

    <p>
      My task this week was the come up with an idea/bill/drawing/timeline/overall
      PLAN for what my physical computation final would be. This wasn't super easy,
      of course. In fact, it was really really tough. At first I wanted to do something
      with water, sand or other natural materials, but I couldn't decide what I wanted
      them to do (I really liked <a class="class1" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2017/the-cosmos-in-the-water/">the cosmos in the water</a>
       from the 2017 winter show but wanted to put a different twist on that kind of interaction with water).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day my inspiration came from another ITP alum, Jayoung Chung.
      In <a class="class1" href="https://vimeo.com/222321677">this video</a> she showcases
      an interactive installation where participants use their bodies to conduct electricity
      and complete a circuit, which turns on a light and plays some audio and such.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really, really love this idea of using bodies as the switches to turn on electronics,
      because it is innately interactive and also involves other people. So, my idea is
      to design a system where participants use their bodies to complete a circuit,
      like in Jayoung's work, which turns on the circuits that power different water jets and LED lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing I have four weeks, I want to spend the first week (possibly two) perfecting
      the construction of a circuit that can be completed when people hug/hold hands/etc.
      I can work on using that as a switch to power something very simple, like an LED light.
      Once I know that works, I can construct the installation it will power, which
      if I have plenty of time will be light and water based or if I have less time will
      just utilize one or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as materials go, I've emailed Jayoung and Yiyao to see what kind of
      things they used for their projects, which hopefully will give me a pretty good
      idea of what I need to go out and buy.
