  <h2>Physical Computation Final Idea</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">

    <p>
      My task this week was the come up with an idea/bill/drawing/timeline/overall
      PLAN for what my physical computation final would be. This wasn't super easy,
      of course.

      I want: something larger, like an installation or something that you wouldn't
      really move around.

      It's more important to just do something instead of spending five days
      thinking about what I SHOULD do.

      Focus on the interaction and the experience which you want people to have.

      Some sort of personal, reflective experience.
