  <h2>Physical Computation Final - Liquid Relationships</h2>

      In my previous blog post I talk about how I got the inspiration for my final
      from human circuits and water, and how I wanted to combine those things. Though my
      idea started out very vague still, there was one very important thing in my mind:
      if you're working with water, it needs to be somehow contained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Link to a rough draft of the project: <a class="class1" href="https://youtu.be/dLwI_hSg0yM">here</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      I started out with a fish tank that I used as a kid. It was pretty big, maybe
      50 gallons or so, so I thought I could have some good interactions in there
      whatever I decided to end up doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I knew what I'd hold the water in, I needed to get started on a touch circuit.
      I googled for "human touch circuit" on Google and found <a class="class1" href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/16150/human-circuit-trigger">this diagram, </a>
      I followed the instructions and duplicated the circuit that's shown in the diagram,
      but it didn't seem to be working correctly. What I figured out by using the serial
      monitor was that the threshold, as set in the diagram, was way too low. I was
      getting values in the thousands, and once I reset the threshold the circuit worked
      perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After figuring out the touch sensor, I needed to decide what it would turn on.
      In my head, I imagined there would be some mechanism that made the water churn
      until the two wires were touched, and then the water would calm down and
      there would be lights shining up from the bottom of the tank. The problem was,
      I didn't know what I could do to make the water churn. I originally thought of having
      an air pump which would be attached to a hose, and I thought I could lay the hose
      along the bottom of the tank and have the pump blow bubbles through the tank.
      The problem was, I didn't have an air pump and didn't really know where to find one.
      I talked with Nicole Cabalquinto, another student, because I heard she had worked with
      water before, and she told me she had an aquarium pump I could borrow.

    <p>
      I tried the pumps in my kitchen sink and found they were... quite forceful.
      With that in mind, I decided to try laying the pumps on their sides in the
      tank, so they would push the water around and make it churn. I also bought
      some black sand and glitter to put in the tank, so you could tell the water was
      spinning around. This looked okay as a demo, but I wasn't sure what the final
      product would look like.

      Though originally my plan had been to have people complete the circuit by standing
      on conducive panels without shoes and then touching, during playtesting a lot of
      people told me they didn't want to take their shoes off. This made sense to me, and
      I also realized that at the show people would be moving by really fast. With that in mind,
      I decided to switch my idea to use hand panels instead of foot panels. Also at playtesting
      I came up with the idea of adding pressure sensors so the installation would know when people
      were there, which would also help to get people into the positions I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the pressure pads, I followed <a class="class1" href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-a-DIY-Pressure-Plate-Switch-to-Automate-Your-H/">this guide </a>
      to make the pressure pad. Originally the touch switch and the pressure switches
      had a problem, which was that there was so much noise that the readings were going
      all over the place and the switches would turnn on and off rapidly. To solve the problem,
      I took the averages of a series of readings instead of just using the single reading.
      This smoothing effect made the switches work the way I wanted to.
