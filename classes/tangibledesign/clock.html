  <h2>Flower Clock</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For some reason, when I heard the assignment was to build a clock, I immediately thought of a flower clock -- a hypothetical device where one could use flowers to tell time by measuring when the flowers opened and closed. The problem with flower clocks is that... they don't really work. But I love flowers, and I love incorporating nature into my work, so I thought why not build, instead of a flower clock, a clock with a flower?

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Three red arcade buttons from Tinkersphere (click <a href="https://tinkersphere.com/buttons-switches/806-redarcadebutton.html" class="class2">here</a> to view).
      </li>
      <li>
        A four pin rocker switch, also from Tinkersphere (click <a href="https://tinkersphere.com/buttons-switches/841-rocker-switch-dpst-4-pin.html" class="class2">here</a> to view).
      </li>
      <li>
        One 6" by 2" and one 6" by 6" bamboo drawer organizer from The Container Store (click <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/s/clearance/stackable-bamboo-drawer-organizers-old/1d?productId=10023938&country=US&currency=USD&utm_source=tcscompshop&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=google&cid=cse%7Cevergreen%7Cclearance%7Cgoogle%7C%7C%7Bcampaignid%7D%7C%7Bproduct_id%7D%7C%7Bdevice%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMImprip7jL5wIViZyzCh3YrAbzEAQYASABEgL7MPD_BwE" class="class2">here</a> to view).
      </li>
      <li>
        One plant from the Home Depot gardening section.
      </li>
      <li>
        Potting soil, also from the Home Depot gardening section.
      </li>
      <li>
        Various wires and resistors held together with a microcontroller.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fabrication</h3>
    <p>
      My plan was to use the plant as part of the clock's control interface, and I decided that I would make the clock so that by touching the plant you could change time or set an alarm. Making the plant-touching work required the use of Arduino's CapSense library, which is phenomenally easy to use. Just by putting a wire into the soil of the plant, I could detect when someone was touching it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the capsense figured out, I needed to decide on how I would change the time. I bought three arcade buttons from Tinkersphere, one to use as hours, one to use as minutes, and one to use as seconds. I also bought a rocker switch since I wanted my flower clock to have both a time set and an alarm function.
    </p>
    <p>
      I organized my materials so that the electronics sat in the smaller bamboo organizer above the potted plant, since I didn't want any water to get on my microcontroller or buttons ans ruin them. I needed to fabricate a control panel for the buttons and rocker switch, which took a lot of tries prototyping on cardboard because the dimensions of the rocker switch were off on the Tinkersphere site. Once I had all the dimensions down correctly, I put the panel mount elements of my control panel in and soldered wires to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, all that remained was putting the pieces together. I put the microcontroller inside the smaller box, drilled a small hole through the bottom so the wire could go into the plant soil, drilled another hole into the side so the micro-USB could go through, and after attaching the control panel to the microcontroller I screwed it all in. Then I spread some potting soil on the bottom layer and put my plant in!
