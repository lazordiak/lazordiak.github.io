    <h2>BOM</h2>
    <p>
      For my bill of materials, I need:
    </p>
    <p>
      A knitted stretch sensor, made of conductive yarn knitted together with regular yarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breadboard
    </p>
    <p>
      An Arduino Nano
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumper cables
    </p>
    <p>
      Alligator clips
    </p>
    <p>
      A speaker
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight buttons
    </p>
    <h2>Interaction Diagram</h2>
    <p>
      The musician starts by wrapping the DIY stretch sensor around their waist and positioning themselves
      by the control panel, which is made up of eight buttons (these correspond to
      whatever scale is being played). The MIDI output is comprised of two operations working in tandem.
      The Arduino reads the resistance of the stretch sensor, which is mapped to different chords
      of the musician's choosing. Then, the musician can play a melody by using the different buttons.
      The chord and the melody are output to a speaker or audio jack.
