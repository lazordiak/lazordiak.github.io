  <h2>Breathing Instrument</h2>
  <br />
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      The idea behind this instrument is a stretch sensor that the user can wear around their stomach and use
      to control MIDI signals to a DAW. The sensor takes all the triads of G Major and plots them
      to different resistances to determine which triad to send. Additionally, the user
      can press different buttons to sound different notes on the G scale.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspiration and Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      Breathing is a central concept in music, from the necessity to control one's breath
      when playing something like the trumpet or flute, to the breath marks in musical notation,
      that I felt compelled to explore it further. Inspired by <a class="class1" href="https://caro.io/breath-awareness">this project</a>,
      which uses a stretch sensor to measure one's breathing, I decided I would turn the breathing
      sensor into an instrument one could control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is my initial sketch concept for the idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, I was looking for a stretch sensor such as the previos project had used.
      Adafruit had a stretch sensor <a class="class1" href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Breath-Sensor-with-Arduino-Conductive-Knitted-/">
      made of conductive rubber</a> which looked promising, but unfortunately due to COVID they
      were out of stock. The rest of the conductive rubber I found was quite expensive, so I set out to find
      a cheaper way of doing the same thing. Doing some research online dug up <a class="class1" href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Breath-Sensor-with-Arduino-Conductive-Knitted-/">this guide</a> for making a stretch sensor using conductive yarn.
      This seemed like a promising idea, and I thought it would work well if this were something people
      were supposed to wear. Using yarn made it more like clothing and opened up the
      idea of integrating it into a wearable, which is also something I had explored in the
      initial sketch above.

      recommend going with a yarn that's equally stretchy but a bit thicker.

      this one</a> from Adafruit (bought through Amazon since Adafruit isn't shipping). This yarn
      was good, but be aware it's very thin and can snap easily. Also, 35 feet is not nearly enough for anything substantial.

      these</a> because they have a base which can easily plug into a breadboard.

      multicolored, but the color doesn't really matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I didn't get to use it, this <a class="class1" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14045">particle sensor</a>
      from Sparkfun was very cheap and seemed interesting, so I picked it up. I thought maybe
      I could use to measure pulse, which would be a good complement to breathing.

    <h2>System Diagram</h2>
    <h2>Process 1: Finding the sound</h2>
    <p>
      From the outset, I had a few specific ideas about how I wanted my instrument to sound. I really
      enjoy very wide and lush sounds, like organs or drone music. The music of Disasterpeace
      was something I especially enjoyed the thought of emulating.
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvIKpAhFGOg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
      After more searching, I settled on Radiohead's Motion Picture Soundtrack as the
      kind of sound I wanted to capture. I checked which instrument the song was using and saw it was a pump organ, so I went looking
      for pump organ soundfonts in order to emulate one.
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcSvMFm2ABE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
      Eventually I found this <a class="class1" href="https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/documents/11-organs/461-decrescedno-pump-organ">'descrescendo' pump organ soundfont</a> on polyphone-soundfonts.com. After playing
      around with it I thought the sound was almost perfect -- the only problem is that
      the sound font has almost no sustain and quickly faded to silence, which didn't align
      with the droning sound I wanted to capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Motion Picture Soundtrack is in the key of G Major, I decided my instrument would use all
      of the triad chrds in G Major -- these are G Major A Minor, B Minor, C Major, D Major, E Minor, and
      F# Diminished.
    </p>
    <h2>Process 2: Experimenting with Sound Triggers</h2>
    <p>
      At this point my materials had not arrived due to shipping slowdowns associated with
      COVID, so I practiced pinpointing the sound with the one thing I did have:
      my Arduino. Using the accelerometer, I mapped different positions to different chords.
      Using the noteOn and noteOff functions provided in the MIDI library for Arduino,
      I explored sending different MIDI signals to the DAW I was using, FL Studio. I found that by using a slight delay of 200 ms
      or so when looping, the fact that the decrescendo pump organ had no sustain didn't matter as much and
      wasn't very noticeable, so I got the droning sound I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, during this process my computer crashed,
      and I lost most of the documentation I had from that time, as well as the Arduino code
      I used for the accelerometer. I also lost the use of FL Studio and had
      to switch to LMMS. LMMS didn't seem to work as well for keeping the droning. I did a little recreation
      of the sort of sound I was going for with LMMS.

    <h2>Process 3: Knitting</h2>
    <p>
      Summing up knitting, I would say this: it's quite easy to get started, but very hard to get a hang
      of and master. There's definitely a high ceiling for how much you can learn about knitting,
      one I didn't come close to hitting. Since I only had 35 feet of conductive yarn,
      I wanted to knit a test swatch to see how stretchy the yarn would be and how everything would feel.
      Along with this excellent <a class="class1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b21msW3cS34">instructinal video for left-handed knitters</a>
      I used my roommate's book <a class="class1" href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Time-Knitting-Step-Step/dp/1589238052">First Time Knitting</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/knitting1.jpg" alt="The first section of my Arduno code."/>
    <img src="../../images/knitting2.jpg" alt="The first section of my Arduno code."/>
    <p>
      Below is the result from the prototype. It's around 5 inches and was made with 16 cast ons
      and 2 or 3 rows. Lengthwise it stretched pretty well, so I decided I would model my final
      sensor on it, but with more cast ons to make it a little longer.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/knitting3.jpg" alt="The first section of my Arduno code."/>
    <p>
      Knitting with the two threads together was tough. The book recommended just holding the threads
      together so that they would naturally be knit together, but the different consistency of the stretchy yarn
      and the not stretchy, clingy conductive thread meant that there was a lot more conductive thread going into
      the sensor than the other yarn. In fact, I ran out of conductive thread only using 18
      cast ons and 2 or three rows. Below, it's shown with the alligator clips attached.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/knitting4.jpg" alt="The first section of my Arduno code."/>
    <h2>Process 4: Wiring up the sensors</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, my Arduino broke during this step. However, while testing the sensor there
      were a few things I noticed right off the bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It wasn't very good. I wasn't totally surprised by this, because I'd identified some problems with
      the sensor while knitting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I didn't have any resistors. This made the readings from the sensor both unreliable
      and not varied enough. If I had a few choice resistors to put into my circuit, I'm sure
      I would've gotten better results from analog read.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The yarn was too thin. If you're going to knit something like this, I highly recommend
      using much thicker yarn with the conductive thread. The very thing yarn I had here just meant that all
      the conductive thread was right next to itself, which was counter-productive to what
      I wanted to do.
    </p>
    <h2>Demonstration of Concept</h2>
    <p>
      For this version, I taped the stretch sensor around my waist, and I taped the breadboard
      with Arduino and buttons installed to my shirt. For a final version, I'd definitely want
      something seated in a pocket or sewn on as a patch (that would work best for buttons).

    <h2>Takeaways and next steps</h2>
    <p>
      I think this idea and this sensor definitely have potential, even if they're not
      quite there yet. What I would really like to do next, apart from tidying up the sensor,
      is send MIDI notes on different channels so that I could have multiple sounds coming through at once.
      For example, the pump organ sound font for the chords or the drone and a violin for the button
      seems like a combination I'd be very interested in trying out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this doesn't currently use bluetooth/wifi, I'd also be really interested in adding those features since this
      instrument would be much easier to play if it didn't have to be connected to the computer and could run on external power.
