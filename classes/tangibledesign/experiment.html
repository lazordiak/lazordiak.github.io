    <h2>Accelerometer Music</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, most of my materials have not arrived yet. My thread got here a few days ago, and yesterday I spent a few hours learning how to knit --
      like all things, it's easier said than done, but given a week I think it's doable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even though I didn't have my stuff, there was still a chance to explore how I wanted
      my instrument to sound. So, I got to work using what I did have: an Arduino.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I've got here is a program that can play all the triads in the key of g, and
      can also move between different octaves. The chord is mapped to the y value
      of the accelerometer, with minor chords being right and major chords being left. Holding the
      Arduino left moves the octave down one, while moving it right moves the octave
      up one. For the sound, I used FL Studio's DirectWave player, which can play
      sound fonts. The sound font I've used is the <a class="class1" href="https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/documents/11-organs/461-decrescedno-pump-organ">"Decrescendo" Pump Organ</a>
      on polyphone-soundfonts.com. I had really wanted to emulate the organ-sounding
      intstrument in Radiohead's <a class="class1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcSvMFm2ABE">Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>,
      and this came pretty close.
