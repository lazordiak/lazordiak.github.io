  <h2>AR Interaction... Defeated Mouse</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For our final assignment we had to work on getting AR with Vuforia up and running
      in Unity. The first part of getting this working, and the most challenging, was
      actually getting Vuforia and Unity to work together. I had to update and upgrade
      and import packages so many times, but the webcam I used wasn't registering with
      the AR software. In the end, I uninstalled Unity completely and reinstalled it and
      Vuforia, which finally got the whole thing working.

      For the image tracker, we were supposed to use something with distinctive markings,
      so I used the coaster that was right next to me on the side table.

      I went onto Mixamo to find a character and ended up choosing a strange-looking mouse.
      I put his model onto the image tracker and turned onto the AR camera and he showed
      up, which was a good first step.

      Actually getting it to animate was also very confusing. The first time I tried,
      Unity crashed my computer. Then I couldn't figure out the right way to download
      the animation or where to put it. The secret is to download the animation from
      Mixamo on the character you want "with skin" and then use the animation file
      instead of the model file. Then when you boot up the animator you need to select
      the loop option, or you'll never see your character doing the animation. Eventually,
      though, I got it to work. I chose the "defeat" animation for my mouse because I
      felt thoroughly defeated after the whole thing.
