  <h2>Animation: The Tuna Can</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For our second assignment, we had to use after effects to make an animation.
      My partner and I batted around a few ideas, but we decided we wanted to keep it simple,
      because we felt that the best cartoons involved a simple premise taken to extreme conclusions. Here's out storyboard:

    <img src="../../images/animation1.png" alt="A picture of the headband flashlight I built." width="1000" height="1000">
    <p>
      I can't draw to save my life, so most of the assets were made by my partner Zoe.
      What I focused on was editing and sound design in Premiere. I really enjoyed
      choosing the music and sounds for the project, because I think sound really adds a
      whole new dimension of character to a piece.
