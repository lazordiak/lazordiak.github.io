  <h2>Stop Motion -- The Circuit of Life!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For our first assignment, we were tasked with making a stop motion animation.
      We batted around a few ideas and settled on a film that chronicled the circle
      of life, where our characters were portrayed by different electronic components
      and the action took place on a breadboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of this approach is that we didn't really need to fabricate anything
      or do much character design, since a lot of the components of our physical
      computation kits had human characteristics. For example, LEDs and capacitors
      already have two little legs and a head that make them look like humans.
      For our main characters we had a yellow LED and a blue resistor, and we tell the
      story of them meeting at school, falling in love, growing up together and eventually
      dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it turned out well, I think we could have done with better transitions.
      Though the action was clear to me, it wasn't always as clear to others, which just
      goes to show the importance of user testing.
