  <h2>Final Proposal Idea -- Weather Journals</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      "Weathe Journals" is a proposal for an AI-powered story generation machine that takes weather data as its input and produces short (~500 word) stories based on input from participants.
    </p>
    <h2>Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      "Weather Journals" works by continually fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT2 text generation model. The program will scan the day's weather data and update the model daily based on what it finds. Participants will be able to provide a short prefix that dictates how they want their story to start, and the algorithm will generate the rest of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to address is where I source the text from. There are basically 3 options:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I source the text according to text that I associate with different weather metrics, like illuminance or rain or wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I write the text myself and update it based on the weather I experience each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. I invite people to write text that reflects how the weather makes them feel that day, and train the machine on that (this introduces the problem of content moderation, I don't want people swearing into my neural network).
    </p>
    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      I was inspired by a description of <a class="class1" href="https://massmoca.org/event/ann-hamilton-corpus/">Ann Hamilton's Corpus</a> at the Mass Moca, and I thought it would be interesting if, since the stories are written by the weather, they were dropped down from the sky. I imagine that the participant will input how they'd like their story to start in a little input module, and the the story will generate and drop down on them. They can take it or leave it afterwards. See my (highly detailed) sketch below.
