  <h2>Yet More Final Ideas</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      I'm having a tough time ideating with this one... Here are a few hopefully more refined final ideas.

    <p>
      1: Build-a-memory: I want to give people a platform to explore some of their memories.
      I want to see what they would look like given a certain form or audio quality. So,
      some sort of interface to do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      2: Weather Stories: I think weather should be able to tell its own story. Can
      we translate that data into something more human? If I use something like GPT2 to
      generate random stories against certain parameters, we can use weather as the input
      data and make stories accordingly.

    <p>
      3: COVID box of secrets: A sweeter, simpler idea that could be done any time, honestly.
      When you can't be as present with people, you can whisper your thoughts and secrets to a box on the street.
      The next person can hear it and leave something for others. Audio-based. Would detect
      via proximity, I think.
