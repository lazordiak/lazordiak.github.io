      In the end I ended up skimming through all three galleries. What I enjoy the most in all three is the way known variables and inputs are transformed into something new. I especially liked the weather station serendipity project The Weather Followers, particularly because serendipity is something that's been on my mind lately.

      The internet has become very standardized, more and more standardized all the time, as the big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter strive to become the only places where people go. They want to become hubs through which you get your news, entertainment, and everything else. Though I was quite young for most of it, I miss the days of the early internet when you could run across totally crazy things almost by accident, like someone's personal site or a weird fanclub blog.

      In the weather followers one in particular, forces we can't control are bringing that little bit of serendipity and randomness to our actions. I think the only thing I would do differently is that I don't think the outputs all line up. Rain controls audio, wind controls a drawing... I think it should all be tied together a bit more, different facets of the same thing, rather than three different outputs.

      I also really really liked "A memory, an ideal, a proposition". Conceptual art is something I really enjoy, and a strong concept for me can make up often for weak execution even. In this piece, I think the cloud is such a poignant way of exploring our relationship to abstract concepts. Clouds float above us, far off and forever untouchable, in much the same way as concepts like "ideal" do.
