  <h2>ARduino 2: Integrating Voice</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This past week we were brainstorming about using different forms of input
      and output for AR -- some of the ones like heat, wind, and such are ones
      I'm already exploring in my intangible interactions class, which is a
      useful overlap. I decided to continue with my ARduino project by introducing
      a new mode of interaction with it; touch was very hard to do right on the tiny
      points of pin on my Arduino, so I thought my app might work a lot better if
      it was voice controlled.
    </p>
    <h3>Giving Arduino Personality</h3>
    <p>
      Part of what we had talked about in class was the potential for users, in
      interacting with objects, to explore them in a way that gave them personality
      (ironically this is ALSO something I'm touching in intangible interaction).
      The easiest way I can think of to make something personable is to give it
      a face, as my studies in cognitive science (as well as our intuition) will
      tell us that as humans we can't resist anything with a face. So, I gave my
      Arduino two big eyes, a smile, and a friendly little text box saying "Hi!"
    </p>

    <p>
      After the face, we needed the data. I put in a few pins first just to make
      sure things were going to work: ground, power, A0, A1, D2, D3.

    <h3>Integrating Voice</h3>
    <p>
      Luckily, Windows has a surprisingly good speech recognition module already
      built into Windows 10, and by switching Unity's build engine in the player
      settings to "Universal Windows Platform" I was able to quickly and easily
      integrate it into my project. The voice recognition is robust, and I was
      getting adequate responses to phrases which weren't even real words, like
      A0, A1, and PWM, which was very promising!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got the voice recognition working consistently I knew it was time to put in the rest of
      the pin texts -- my Arduino in Unity ended up looking like some sort of
      centipede.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin with, I initialized the SetActive state of all the elements containing
      text to off, keeping on only the eyes and the initial "hi". I wanted to structure
      my voice commands so that the user could easily and intuitively switch between
      some of the pins to see where they were, though first I couldn't help programming
      in a nice little personal touch -- first you have to say hi back to the
      Arduino to get it to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the text display to switch every time a new pin number was said out
      loud, I put in a switch case. When it recognizes a phrase, it goes through all
      the pins and sets them off, then finds the pin with the same name as the word
      and turns it on. (The trick to turning a text mesh off and on is to attach it
      to a parent, and then you can turn it off and on through the parent instead of
      turning it off directly).
    </p>
    <p>
      After coding my huge switch statement I was sure I'd get an error, but to
      my surprise it worked right the first time -- and it actually worked really
      well! See it in action below.
