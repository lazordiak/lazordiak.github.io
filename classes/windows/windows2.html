  <h2>A Feast For The Eyes</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This week we're building out Unity apps in AR onto our mobile devices -- mine's an Android, so I downloaded Android Studio and plugged in my phone. Building out to Unity was much easier than I thought, since after everything was finished I just had to press the "build and run" option.
    </p>

      For the assignment, I was preoccupied with the mainly visual nature of AR which we had talked about last week, and the phrase "feast for the eyes" kept popping up in my head. So, I got out my dinner plates and coasters and set them up in a row to use as image targets. I searched Unity's asset store and found a free RPG food pack that came with animations already built in, which was perfect -- it looked like I was actually eating the food when I held the camera over it. For the end, I wanted a bit of a twist to emphasize the mixed reality nature of the AR and of the assignment, so I thought... why not transition from a "virtual" cola to a real one? I love this idea of blurring the lines.
