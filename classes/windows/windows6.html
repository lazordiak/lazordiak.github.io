      For this week, I was trying to get my AR Band project from last week working
      correctly with LightEstimation. Unfortunately... it didn't work. Here's the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first problem is that the documentation for a lot of AR Foundation's stuff is
      out of date. A lot of the things referenced in the tutorial videos and official
      tutorials don't exist in the modern AR Foundation package, which focuses on
      managers instead of individual scripts. Because of that I had to do a deep
      dive into the AR Camera Manager scripts and the Light Estimation script from the
      AR Foundation tutorial.
