  <h2>AR Band</h2>

      This week's theme was "the city". God knows I am always trying to inspire a
      closer look at the world around us, and I wanted to get a little more creative
      about my outputs and the way AR interacts with the real world. When I learned
      that AR Foundation could do light estimation in order to render lighting on the
      AR components dynamically, I thought I could repurpose it for my own ends. My
      idea was that according to different lighting conditions one could place different
      instruments which played different sounds, and that way your environment would dictate
      what kind of songs you play -- by traveling around you could dictate the music
      you heard.
    </p>

      I watched through some tutorials on AR Foundation and ARCore (since I was working
      on Android), and after some tinkering I was able to fashion a placement indicator
      and make my Raycasts work. I also explored how audio works in Unity for the first
      time, and was able to attach a small guitar riff to a guitar prefab I got from
      Google Poly. The guitar successfully got placed, and played the music, but
      try as I may I couldn't figure out how to access the LightEstimation variable
      that AR Foundation was supposed to have.
