    <p>
      Words With Dates is a (low-tech) dating game to help dates intuit whether
      or not they're on the same wavelength. Once the game starts, the two people
      will look through a list of words and decide on one which they want to convince
      their partner to choose. They have 30 seconds to do this without gestures or words.
      After the time is up, users input a word. If they put in the same word they're
      perfect for each other. If not, it probably wasn't meant to be.

      Will partners successfully communicate their feelings to each other? Will the
      two people pick an entirely different word? Is love a lie? Who knows! Find out by
      clicking <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dating---?path=public/output/script.js:1:0" class="class3">here</a>.
