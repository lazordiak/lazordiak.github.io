  <h2>An Industrial Nature Sculpture!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This class's assignment dealt with using different materials besides just
      plywood and acrylic, and fastening it all together. I started thinking about
      some crazy materials that I might never use otherwise, like sand or bone or
      such, which led me to the idea of visiting all the wholesalers I'd never
      gotten around to checking out. I live in Chelsea and the flower wholesale
      district is right around the corner, as well as the garment district. At the
      first wholesaler I went to, I found a wicker basket in the shape of a deer,
      with an eye and an ear missing. I won't lie: I fell in love with this deer
      and decided I wanted to use it for my project.

      Another item that caught my eye was a cut from a log. The deer seemed to fit
      quite naturally upon it, so I came up with the idea for some kind of autumn
      scene with the deer as the centerpiece.

      Originally, I was thinking of using leaves and flowers and other natural
      materials, but then my friend came up with the idea of using industrial materials.
      I really liked the idea of contrasting nature with industry and especially
      of making a nature scene with non-nature themed items, so I decided to visit
      some other wholesalers and see what I could pick up.

      After going to Canal Rubbers, Canal Plastics, a few lighting shops, through
      the leather district, to Lowes and to a recycling center I thought I had enough
      odds and ends to do something with. I had: some drawer knobs, some rubber
      stoppers of some sort, steel wool, a sheet of (mostly) unused aluminum, some
      metal bars, a brass knob for something, and a circuit board I looted from a remote.
      The next part was to figure out how to put them together.

    <img src="../../images/deer8.jpg" alt="A brass tap." />
    <img src="../../images/deer9.jpg" alt="Steel wool." />
    <p>
      I decided to set the deer back at the rear of the log, and I gave him a tack
      and a small piece of aluminum to replce his ear and eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the left side of the log I used the rubber plugs and drawer knobs to make a field
      of mushrooms. I used Titebond Quick&Thick to glue them to the wood, since the screws that
      came with them were not big enough to go all the way through the log.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the right side, I nibbled out a square of aluminum and drilled through it, then
      screwed it into the wood. I I then glued three of the metal logs on top of it,
      thinking it looked a little like a campfire.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/deer12.jpg" alt="A piece of aluminum screwed onto a log." />
    <p>
      I put a tangle of wire on top of the brass knob so that it looked like a tree,
      then glued it above the aluminum. I took some tin foil and ran it through the center
      so that it looked like a river, then used some photoresistors that looked
      like cattails and buttons that looked like little crabs. Then I threw in a circuitboard
      and screwed some bolts in and the sculpture was done.
