  <h2>Five Smiling Faces</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For this Intro to Fabrication project, we had to make five of something. I thought
      about this a while, wondering what I needed. Soap holders? Phone holders? Picture frames?
      As it turns out I do need soap holders, but I only realized that after I started
      making smiley faces, so this project is five smiley faces! Because I think you can't
      go wrong making smiley faces, just to bring some more joy into the world. :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the reason I decided on smileys is because I wanted to make something that
      would use every machine in the wood shop, since it seemed in the spirit of this
      week's lesson. First, I went out and bought a big piece of wood -- more than I needed,
      but always buy more than you need!
    </p>
    <p>
      I cut this huge piece of wood in half and prepared to start drilling out my smileys.
      To do this, I attached a 3 and 3/4 inch hole saw to the drill press, clamped my wood down,
      and started drilling.

    bit, with my wood clamped underneath it."/>
    <p>
      Partway through cutting out my smileys, I realized screw clamps are amazing and
      started using them instead. Much better.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point I had four circles of wood. I rigged a jig up so I could slide my smileys
      in and start drilling the eyes. I would slide a smiley in, drill halfway through the wood
      to give the impression of an eyehole, then rotate the smiley ninety degrees and drill the
      other eye. Jigs sped it up a lot! Because I wasn't drilling all the way through, I didn't put
      a board underneath.
    </p>

    press, pressed up against a jig. I am drilling the eyes."/>
    <p>
      To drill the mouths I wanted to use the scroll saw (this thing is honestly the most
      terrifying one to me). To drill from inside the smiley John told me I needed a quarter inch
      hole to drill from, so I drilled two quarter inch holes in my smileys so I could use
      them as guideposts for the mouths. This meant, of course, more jigs.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/smiley6.jpg" alt="A picture of one of my smileys under the drill press.

    <p>
      I had a bit of a hard time figuring out where to drill the mouth each time, then had
      (what seemed to me) like a brilliant idea. Why not line the smileys up on top of each
      other so that all the other holes aligned, then drill through the top hole mouth
      into the bottom, so that way the mouths would align? This... kind of worked.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/smiley7.jpg" alt="A picture of one of my smileys on top of another
    on the drill press, with the holes aligned."/>
    <p>
      After all the holes were drilled for the mouths, it was time to take them to the scroll
      saw. I drew guidelines between the mouth holes so I could saw through the lines for the
      mouths, forgetting that I am a terrible drawer with no ability to keep my hands still,
      which meant the guide lines looked not so great.
    </p>

    lines drawn between the two mouth holes"/>
    <p>
      The scroll saw needed to be adjusted a few times, but once I finally figured out how to
      do it I sawed through the mouths. This also didn't go perfectly, but they were all smmiling
      at least.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, I took the smileys to the belt sander. I sanded off the frontmost part of the face
      so there would be no pencil lines left, then sanded all around the edges and back so that they
      were nice and smooth and wouldn't give anyone a splinter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though I technically had five smileys on my hands at this point, I wanted to go a bit further
      and drill the eyes bigger, since most smileys have big eyes. I chose a 3/4 inch circular bit
      to drill and lined the smileys up on the drill press. Since I already had a hole for the eyes,
      I didn't need a jig or anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was... not what I expected. To be frank, my smileys looked incredibly creepy.
      There were a couple of things I could do about this. I could just drill all the way through
      the eyes, which would probably look better. But I had a different idea. Since Halloween was
      coming up, why not rebrand. So these are no longer smileys. They are Halloween decorations!
      Give one to your kid and give them some paint, and they can turn it into a vampire or ghost
      or skeleton! Perfect.
