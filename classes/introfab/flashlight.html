  <h2>Homemade Flashlight</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For out first project in Intro to Fabrication, we were asked to make a flashlight.
      The definition of a flashlight in this context was:
    </p>
    <p>
        Something portable, which produces light.
    </p>
    <p>
        I immediately set off for the Junk Shelf, which has a bunch of stuff that
        people have discarded for one reason or another, in the hopes that I could find
        something to inspire me (and also something I could use for free). Immediately,
        I found a tea light!! I thought this was super serendipitous, since if I could
        take it apart I already had something that could make light, which was useful
        because I didn't know the first thing about wiring.
      </p>
