  <h2>Laser-Cut Maps</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      For this assignment, we had to make something on the laser cutter. This was
      a double-project for me, because I knew nothing about either laser cutters or
      Adobe Illustrator, which is what laser cutter projects (at least at ITP) run
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I was considering trying to draw something on Adobe Illustrator, but
      my friend who's a designer said that was a terrible idea and that I would just
      be better off importing designs that I wanted to cut. I briefly considered
      making a pattern that was a skull on one side and a face on the other,
      inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vo3zVO76-Q" class="class1">this video</a>,
      but then I got the idea for one of those laser-cut maps you see all over the.
      I'd always thought those were cool, and then I'd have something to hang up in
      my apartment for once.
    </p>

      It turns out that not only are there guides for this, but that epilog lasers
      (which is the brand our laser cutter is) actually has
      <a href="https://www.epiloglaser.com/how-it-works/video/cutting-engraving-maps-illustrator/" class="class1">
      its own guide</a> to cutting engraving and vector cutting maps. It took me
      about an hour to figure out image trace, expand, and all the other stuff I had
      to do to get a printable map, but I finally had one. I chose Kathmandu, which
      is the first city I really lived in when I started traveling. I ended up with
      two files in Adobe Illustrator, one for cutting and one for engraving.

    <img src="../../images/map1.jpg" alt="An Adobe Illustrator file depicting a map of Kathmandu, for cutting."/>
    <img src="../../images/map2.jpg" alt="An Adobe Illustrator file depicting a map of Kathmandu, for engraving."/>
    <p>
      Honestly, that was the easy part. Next I had to find the right materials and
      settings that would make the map actually look good when engraved. I found
      some thin pieces of nice-looking wood in the scrap pile, but first I wanted
      to prototype the design on cardboard.
