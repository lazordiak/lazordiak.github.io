  <h2>The Dead Man's Music Box!</h2>

  <div class="wrapper">

      This class's assignment was about mounting and using a motor in your project.
      As soon as I saw these <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10976">motorized
      potentiometers</a> from Sparkfun I knew I had this idea for an audio system
      that, if left alone, would always turn the music all the way up. It was like 2001
      A Space Odyssey except HAL is a computer that really wants the music to be loud.

      To start, I bought a bamboo utensil organizer from The Container Store. After talking
      with my Pcomp partner, we decided this idea could be our Pcomp midterm, and instead
      of a computer the musix box could be haunted by a ghost. With this idea in mind,
      I prototyped a control panel for the box.

      It looks a little wonky because the laser cutter at the MakerSpace works a
      little differently than the one at ITP, but the idea was sound. So, I went ahead
      and tried to implement this in acrylic.
