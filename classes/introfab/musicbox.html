      This class's assignment was about mounting and using a motor in your project.
      As soon as I saw these <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10976">motorized
      potentiometers</a> from Sparkfun I knew I had this idea for an audio system
      that, if left alone, would always turn the music all the way up. It was like 2001
      A Space Odyssey except HAL is a computer that really wants the music to be loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, I bought a bamboo utensil organizer from The Container Store. After talking
      with my Pcomp partner, we decided this idea could be our Pcomp midterm, and instead
      of a computer the musix box could be haunted by a ghost. With this idea in mind,
      I prototyped a control panel for the box.

      It looks a little wonky because the laser cutter at the MakerSpace works a
      little differently than the one at ITP, but the idea was sound. So, I went ahead
      and tried to implement this in acrylic. It worked really well the first time,
      surprisingly. I was really worried in particular about the spacing of the holes
      for the screws that would attach the potentiometer, which were 120 mm apart,
      but everything was spaced correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a LONG time carefully sharpie-ing in all the etched in designs, because
      I forgot you could use the sharpie dry erase marker trick to do it quickly. Silly
      of me. I also taped some wires to come out of the "emergency off switch" button space
      so it looked like the button was torn out, which I thought was cute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the motor was mounted and the design was done, I wanted to screw it into the
      container, but there really wasn't enough space in the corners to do it. So, I glued
      some wooden blocks in so I would have something to drill.
      </p>
    <p>
      The circuit worked and moved the knob, but not incredibly well. After the video
      it started acting wonky (isn't that always the case?). The last thing I did was
      laser etch a little warning sign, which I screwed to the side of the box. Then it
      was done!
