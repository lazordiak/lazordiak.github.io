  <h2>HagQuest - An Epic Story Told in Flask</h2>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>"You stand at the edge of a vast desert...." So begins the greatest tale of our time.</p>
    <p>HagQuest is an interactive fiction game (think Zork) programmed in Python as a collaberation between me and my good friend <a href="https://bktidswell.github.io" class="class1">Ben Tidswell.</a> In it, the protagonist (who must be named Jarek
      Lenda) seeks to clean the messy house of a hag in order to enlist her help on a perilous quest into the desert.</p>

    <p>HagQuest was built partially as an attempt to make something fun and partially as an attempt to learn how to use Python's Flask microframework. On both counts I like to think of it as a success.</p>
    <p>Don't take my word for it, though: try it yourself <a href="https://haq-quest.herokuapp.com" class="class1">here</a>, or if that doesn't work just download the code from my <a href="https://github.com/lazordiak/HagQuest" class="class1">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>I wasn't kidding, though. You have to name yourself Jarek Lenda.</p>
