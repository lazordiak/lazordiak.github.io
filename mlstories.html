    <p>
      These are a series of explorations of AI-generated stories using the <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple" class="class1">GPT-2 simple wrapper</a> for OpenAI's GPT model. The impetus for this project was Dan O'Sullivan's "Rest of You" class, which I took at ITP in the spring of 2020. In that class, we augmented our lives with technology in an effort to understand ourselves in ways we couldn't before. As someone who's identified as a writer, both professionally and personally, for a long time, I became obsessed with the idea of isolating and experimenting with "my style".

    <p>
      Was my style of communication truly transferable? Was it even the style, rather than the content, of what I wrote that defined it? Could I learn anything about how I view the world by throwing it into a machine? I wasn't sure, so I threw it into a machine anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      To train the model, I followed a lot of the recommendations of <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/" class="class1">this blog post</a> from Max Woolf, who loads the files for the model (using the GPT2-Simple wrapper) onto Google's Collaboratory. I made a few tweaks of my own and then trained the the medium-sized model (biggest one available on Collaboratory).
